                          PLUTO — PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION
================================================================================

Version: 1.1
Last updated: February 2025

This document describes Pluto, its features, and how users interact with the
platform. It is intended as the primary reference for the product.


================================================================================
1. INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

1.1 What is Pluto?

Pluto is a loyalty and rewards platform. Users create an account, earn loyalty
points through activities such as daily rewards, completing quests, and
referrals, and spend those points on platform features—including creating
campaigns, adding quests, using ChainLens, Trendcraft, PulseBot, and tipping on
Agora. Users can also purchase additional loyalty points via a mock wallet
integration.

1.2 Why the name Pluto?

The project is named Pluto because Pluto stands apart from the other planets—
its orbit, composition, and classification make it distinct. In the same way,
the web3 community is distinct: it operates on different principles, rewards
participation and ownership, and brings together creators, developers, and
users in a unique ecosystem. Pluto the platform aims to reflect that
distinctiveness by offering a unified space for loyalty, quests, social
interaction, and AI-powered tools that serve this community.

1.3 Who is it for?

  - End users: People who want to earn rewards, complete quests, join campaigns,
    use social features (Agora), explore trends (Trendcraft), use an AI
    companion (PulseBot), or check wallet insights (ChainLens).

  - Campaign creators: Users who create campaigns and add quests (e.g. "Follow
    us on X", "Share a tweet") and reward participants with loyalty points.

  - Administrators: Users with admin rights can moderate Agora content (e.g.
    hide reported posts) and view reports.

1.4 Core concepts

  Loyalty points
    The in-app currency. Users earn them (daily claim, quests, referrals,
    wallet purchase) and spend them (campaigns, quests, ChainLens, Trendcraft,
    PulseBot, Agora tips).

  Campaigns
    Collections of "quests" that may be time-bound or open-ended. Only the
    campaign owner can add or edit quests; any logged-in user can participate
    and verify quests to earn points.

  Quests
    Tasks (e.g. follow a handle, share a link) that participants complete and
    verify. Completing a quest awards a fixed number of loyalty points.

  Agora
    The in-app social layer: posts, likes, replies, tips (in loyalty points),
    follow and followers, bookmarks, direct messages, and notifications.


================================================================================
2. NOVELTY
================================================================================

Pluto brings together several dimensions that are often treated separately:

  Unified loyalty across features
    A single loyalty-point economy ties together campaigns and quests, social
    tipping (Agora), wallet intelligence (ChainLens), trend discovery and AI
    content (Trendcraft), and an AI companion over Telegram (PulseBot). Users
    earn in one place and spend across the whole product, which encourages
    exploration and retention.

  Gamified campaigns and quests
    Campaign creators run time-bound or open-ended campaigns with verifiable
    quests (e.g. follow, tweet, link). Participants prove completion and earn
    points; creators spend points to add quests. The flow is built for
    community growth and engagement rather than one-off actions.

  Social layer with loyalty-native tips
    Agora is a full social feed (posts, likes, replies, follow, DMs,
    notifications) where tips are paid in loyalty points, not a separate
    currency. This keeps value inside the platform and makes rewarding
    creators a first-class action.

  AI and external data behind a loyalty gate
    Trendcraft (aggregated trends and AI-generated content) and PulseBot
    (Telegram chat summaries and Q&A) are gated by loyalty points. Users
    trade engagement and points for utility, which balances usage and
    sustainability.

  Public landing with leaderboard, stats, and feedback
    The landing page is not only marketing: it shows a live leaderboard (top
    users by points), platform-wide stats (users, campaigns, quests, points
    earned), and a feedback form whose submissions are stored. This makes
    progress visible and keeps the product open to input from visitors and
    users alike.

  Web3-friendly entry point
    Optional wallet connect and a mock “buy loyalty” flow give a web3-style
    onboarding path without requiring crypto for core actions. The platform
    can grow toward real payments or stay as a loyalty-only product.


================================================================================
3. SCOPE
================================================================================

Pluto’s scope spans the following:

  Product scope
    - User accounts (email/password and Google), profiles, and referral codes.
    - Loyalty points: earn (daily claim, quest completion, referral, mock
      purchase) and spend (campaigns, quests, ChainLens, Trendcraft, PulseBot,
      Agora tips).
    - Campquest: campaigns and quests with creator/participant roles and
      verification (e.g. Twitter/link).
    - ChainLens: wallet intelligence for a given address (costs loyalty).
    - Agora: posts, feed, likes, replies, tips (loyalty), follow, bookmarks,
      DMs, notifications, reports, and admin moderation.

    - Full Agora discovery (e.g. search) and advanced moderation beyond hide
      post.
    - Multi-language or multi-tenant white-label.


================================================================================
4. CHALLENGES FACED
================================================================================

  Loyalty economy design
    Balancing earn and spend so that points feel valuable but not scarce
    required tuning costs (campaign creation, quest add, ChainLens, Trendcraft,
    PulseBot) and rewards (daily claim curve, quest completion, referral).
    Keeping Agora tips in loyalty (min/max amounts, balance checks) without
    fragmenting into a second currency was a deliberate constraint.

  Quest verification
    Verifying that a user actually completed a quest (e.g. followed an
    account, posted a tweet) depends on third-party APIs (Twitter, RapidAPI)
    with rate limits, keys, and sometimes paid plans. Supporting multiple
    verification paths (e.g. bearer token vs. RapidAPI) and clear error
    messages when keys are missing or invalid was necessary for a reliable
    flow.

  Google OAuth and redirect URI
    Using Google OAuth with a redirect (instead of a popup) requires the
    frontend to register the exact callback URL (e.g. /login/callback) in
    Google Cloud Console. Mismatched origins or redirect URIs cause silent
    failures or 400 errors. Aligning Backend (GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID for token
    verification) and Frontend (VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, callback URL) and
    documenting the setup reduced configuration errors.

  Real-time and consistency
    Agora DMs and notifications use Socket.IO for real-time delivery. Keeping
    message order, read state, and notification state consistent across
    clients and restarts (with MongoDB as source of truth) required clear
    event contracts and reconnection handling.

  AI and external APIs
    Trendcraft and PulseBot depend on Gemini and external data (YouTube,
    Reddit, NewsAPI, Telegram). Managing API keys, rate limits, errors (e.g.
    model not found, key invalid), and cost (loyalty deduction) in a
    user-visible way needed centralised error handling and clear feedback in
    the UI.

  Gamified UI and performance
    The Campquest UI uses 3D background (React Three Fiber) and animated
    borders (conic gradient on hover). Keeping the experience smooth on
    mid-range devices while preserving the “gamezone” look required
    constraining particle counts, simplifying shadows, and avoiding
    unnecessary re-renders.

  Feedback and landing data
    Storing landing feedback in the database and exposing leaderboard and
    stats via public APIs meant defining clear schemas (Feedback model) and
    read-only endpoints that do not expose sensitive user data (e.g.
    leaderboard shows username/points, not email).

5.2 Logging in

  Email and password
    The user enters email and password on the login or signup page. After
    successful authentication, the application stores a session token and
    redirects the user (e.g. to home or profile).

  Google
    The user clicks "Continue with Google" on the login page and is redirected
    to Google. After consent, Google redirects back to the application's login
    callback URL with an identity token. The application validates the token,
    creates or retrieves the user account, and issues a session token.

  Logout
    The user clicks "Log out" in the navigation bar. The application clears the
    stored token and the user is treated as signed out.

================================================================================
7. LOYALTY POINTS
================================================================================

Loyalty points are the in-app currency. They are used to unlock features and
reward others (e.g. tips on Agora).

  Earning
    Daily claim (streak of 1–7 days; points increase by day), completing
    quests (fixed reward per quest), referral (new user signs up with your
    code), and wallet purchase (mock).

  Spending
    Creating a campaign, adding a quest, ChainLens lookup, Trendcraft AI
    features, PulseBot summary/ask/stats, and tipping posts or replies on
    Agora.

  Balance
    Shown on the profile and in relevant modals. Actions that require points
    are blocked when the balance is insufficient.


================================================================================
8. LANDING PAGE
================================================================================

The landing page is available at the root URL and does not require login.

  Navbar
    Logo (links to home), links to Campquest, Agora, ChainLens, Trendcraft,
    PulseBot, and either "Log out" with user avatar (when logged in) or "Log
    in" (when not). On small screens a hamburger menu shows these links in an
    overlay; notifications bell and profile stay in the header.

  Hero
    Visual section with headline and short tagline, and a primary call-to-action.

  Features (Built for players)
    Cards for Campquest, PulseBot, ChainLens, Agora, Trendcraft, Wallet, and
    Daily Rewards. Each card has a title, short description, and a visible
    "Try …" link (e.g. Try Agora, Try Campquest) styled as a tappable button.
    Cards grow with content so links are never clipped on mobile.

  Leaderboard (Top players)
    List of users with the highest loyalty points (e.g. top 20). Shows rank,
    username or avatar, and points. Data is loaded from the backend. If there
    is no data or an error, a fallback message is shown.

  Platform stats
    Counts such as number of players (users), campaigns, quests, quests
    completed, and total loyalty points earned. Data is loaded from the
    backend.

  FAQ
    Accordion with questions such as: What are loyalty points? How do I earn
    them? What is Campquest? Is my data safe? What is PulseBot? Answers explain
    the product in plain language.

  Feedback
    Form with required message and optional name and email. On submit, data is
    sent to the backend and stored. A success message is shown; the user can
    send another message.

  Footer
    Links to Features, Leaderboard, Stats, FAQ, Feedback, Docs, Privacy, and
    Terms; copyright notice.


================================================================================
9. AUTHENTICATION
================================================================================

9.1 Sign up (registration)

  The user goes to the signup page and enters email, password, and optionally
  a referral code. On submit, the backend creates a new account. If a valid
  referral code is provided, the referrer receives referral loyalty points. The
  user can then log in with email and password (or may be signed in
  automatically, depending on implementation). Duplicate email returns an
  error.

9.2 Login

  Email and password: The user enters email and password. The backend
  validates and returns a session token. The frontend stores the token and
  redirects the user.

  Google: The user clicks "Continue with Google" and is sent to Google's OAuth
  screen. After consent, Google redirects back to the application with an
  identity token. The backend verifies the token, finds or creates the user,
  and returns a session token. The frontend stores it and redirects the user.

  Invalid credentials or failed Google verification show an error message.

9.3 Login callback (Google)

  The frontend reads the identity token from the redirect URL, sends it to the
  backend, and receives user data and a session token. The frontend stores
  the token and redirects. If verification fails, the user sees an error and
  can return to the login page.

9.4 Session and security

  The session is maintained by the frontend using a token. Protected API
  requests include this token. The token has an expiry (e.g. 7 days); after
  expiry the user must log in again. The application may redirect to the login
  page when the API returns an unauthorized response.


================================================================================
10. PROFILE
================================================================================

The profile page is available to logged-in users and shows the user's
information and loyalty-related actions.

  User information
    Username, email (if available), profile picture (if set). The user can
    update username and profile picture (and possibly other fields) through the
    profile page or a dedicated edit flow.

  Loyalty points
    Current balance is displayed prominently. This balance is used for
    creating campaigns, adding quests, ChainLens, Trendcraft, PulseBot, and
    Agora tips.

  Daily claim
    Status of the daily reward (e.g. "Claim daily" or "Next claim in X"). The
    user can claim once per 24 hours; after claiming, the next claim time and
    streak (e.g. day 2 of 7) are shown. The streak resets if the user misses a
    day (per backend rules).

  Referral
    The user's referral code for sharing. When another user signs up with this
    code, the referrer receives referral loyalty points (e.g. 500 pts).

  Stats
    Summary counts such as campaigns created, campaigns participated in,
    quests completed, and posts count (if Agora is integrated). Links or
    shortcuts to the campaigns list or relevant pages may be provided.

  Buy loyalty (Wallet)
    Button or section to purchase loyalty points. This opens a flow (e.g.
    modal) to connect a wallet (e.g. via RainbowKit) and perform a mock
    purchase: the user selects an amount and "pays" with mock crypto; the
    backend credits loyalty points. No real payment is processed.


================================================================================
11. CAMPQUEST (CAMPAIGNS AND QUESTS)
================================================================================

11.1 Campaigns list

  The user sees a list of campaign cards. Each card shows campaign name,
  description, status (active, draft, or expired), number of quests, number of
  participants, expiry date (if any), and creator.

  Filters: "All" (all campaigns) and "My campaigns" (only campaigns created by
  the current user).

  Create campaign: The user clicks "Create campaign" and enters campaign name,
  description, and optional expiry (in days). Submitting creates the campaign
  and deducts loyalty points (e.g. 100 pts). The user is then taken to the new
  campaign's detail page.

  Clicking a card opens that campaign's detail page.

  The campaigns section uses a gamified visual style: 3D-style background,
  gradient headings, and cards with a thin colorful border on hover.

11.2 Campaign detail

  The header shows campaign name, description, and status. The owner can
  change the status (e.g. active, draft, expired). Metadata includes number of
  quests, number of participants, expiry date, and creator.

  Owner actions:
    Add quest: The owner clicks "Add quest" and enters title, description,
    quest type (e.g. follow, tweet, link), and required link or handle.
    Submitting adds the quest and deducts loyalty points (e.g. 50 pts per
    quest).

    Edit quest: The owner can edit a quest's title, description, required
    link, and type.

    Delete quest: The owner can remove a quest from the campaign.

    Delete campaign: The owner can delete the entire campaign (with
    confirmation).

  Quests list: Each quest shows title, description, type badge, required
  link/handle, and reward (e.g. "+25 pts on completion"). For participants,
  when the campaign is active:
    Verify: The user clicks "Verify" to prove completion (e.g. by providing a
    tweet URL or other proof). The backend (and any third-party checks)
    validate and then award loyalty points (e.g. 25 pts) once per quest. After
    verification, the quest shows as "Verified" and cannot be verified again.

  The campaign detail page uses the same gamified style as the campaigns list.

11.3 Quest types and verification

  Quest types are defined in the backend (e.g. follow, tweet, link). Each type
  has a label and possibly a hint (e.g. placeholder for "required link").
  Verification typically requires the user to provide evidence (e.g. tweet
  URL). The backend may check sentiment or other rules before awarding points.
  If verification fails, the user sees an error and may try again if allowed.


================================================================================
12. CHAINLENS
================================================================================

ChainLens provides wallet intelligence for a given blockchain address.

  The user enters a wallet address (e.g. Ethereum) and submits. One lookup
  costs loyalty points (e.g. 10 pts). If the balance is insufficient, the
  action is blocked and an error is shown.

  The backend uses an external provider (e.g. Moralis) to fetch wallet data.
  The user sees insights such as native balance, token balances (if
  supported), and possibly a short narrative or score (e.g. "Steady activity,"
  "High volatility"). Exact fields depend on backend and UI.

  Caching: When Redis is configured, results for a given wallet address and
  chain are cached for 1 hour. A repeat request for the same address and chain
  within that period returns the cached data and does not deduct loyalty
  points.


================================================================================
13. AGORA (SOCIAL FEED)
================================================================================

Agora is the in-app social layer. The following assumes the Agora frontend is
available (e.g. under /agora or a dedicated section). Access requires login
unless otherwise noted.

13.1 Feeds

  Home feed: Personalized feed for the logged-in user (e.g. posts from
  followed users or algorithm-driven). Paginated (e.g. 50 items per page).

  Trending feed: Posts sorted by popularity (e.g. likes, tips, time). May be
  public (optional auth) so that guests see a limited view if the product
  allows.

  User feed: Posts by a specific user. Used to view someone's posts before
  following.

13.2 Posts

  Create: The user writes content (text; max length e.g. 500 characters) and
  submits. The post appears in feeds and on the user's profile.

  View: Single post view with full content, author, timestamp, like count, tip
  count, reply count. The user can like, reply, tip, or bookmark (if
  implemented).

  Edit/delete: The author can edit or delete their own post. Deletion removes
  the post from feeds and profile.

13.3 Likes and replies

  Like: The user clicks to like a post. One like per user per post; toggling
  removes the like. Like count is visible.

  Reply: The user writes a reply and submits. Replies appear under the post and
  may be paginated (e.g. 50 per page). The post author may receive a
  notification (if implemented).

  Tip reply: The user can send loyalty points as a tip to the reply author,
  subject to the same rules as post tips (min/max amount, balance check).

13.4 Tips (loyalty points)

  Tip a post: The user chooses an amount (within min/max, e.g. 1–1,000,000
  pts) and confirms. Loyalty is deducted from the tipper and credited to the
  post author. Tip count or total tipped may be shown on the post.

  Tip a reply: Same mechanism for a reply; points go to the reply author.

  Sent/received tips: The user can view lists of tips they sent and tips they
  received for transparency.

13.5 Follow and profile

  Follow/unfollow: On a user's profile or from a post, the user can follow or
  unfollow. Follower and following counts are visible on the profile. The
  home feed may include posts from followed users.

  User profile: Shows username, avatar (if any), follower/following counts, and
  posts by that user. The user can follow/unfollow and view follower/following
  lists (paginated). A "most tipped" users list may be available.

13.6 Bookmarks

  The user can bookmark a post to read later. A bookmark list (e.g. "My
  bookmarks") shows all bookmarked posts; the user can remove a bookmark.

13.7 Direct messages (DMs)

  Conversations: The user sees a list of conversations (each with another
  user). Clicking opens the conversation thread.

  Start conversation: The user can start a new conversation with another user
  (e.g. from their profile or a "Message" button). If a conversation already
  exists, that thread opens.

  Messages: Inside a conversation, messages are listed (paginated, e.g. 50 per
  page). The user can send a new text message (e.g. max 2000 characters).
  Real-time updates may be supported via WebSocket.

13.8 Notifications

  The user sees a list of notifications (e.g. "X liked your post," "Y
  replied," "Z followed you," "W tipped you"). Paginated (e.g. 20 per page).
  The user can mark a single notification as read or "Mark all as read." Read
  state is stored.

  On small screens the notification panel is responsive: narrower and shorter
  (e.g. max 260px width, 50vh height) so it stays within the viewport; text
  wraps to avoid horizontal overflow.

13.9 Reports and moderation

  Report post: The user can report a post (e.g. inappropriate content). The
  report is stored and may be listed for admins.

  Report user: The user can report another user. Same as above for admins.

  Admin: Admins can view a list of reports (posts and users) and take action
  (e.g. "Hide post"). Hidden posts are no longer visible in public or trending
  feeds (per backend logic).


================================================================================
14. TRENDCRAFT
================================================================================

Trendcraft provides aggregated trends and AI-assisted content.

  Aggregated trends: The user can view a feed of trending content from
  multiple sources (e.g. YouTube, Reddit, Hacker News, NewsAPI). The feed may
  be paginated; each item shows source, title, link, and possibly a short
  summary.

  Content generation (AI): The user can request AI-generated content (e.g. a
  tweet or short post) based on context or topic. This uses a backend AI
  service (e.g. Gemini) and costs loyalty points (e.g. 3 pts per request). The
  user enters input (e.g. topic or prompt); the result is displayed and can
  be copied or used elsewhere.

  Content suggestions: The user can request a list of content-type suggestions
  (e.g. "tweet," "thread," "blog") from the AI. Same cost (e.g. 3 pts). The
  result is a short list of suggestions.

  If the balance is insufficient for a paid action, the backend returns an
  error and the frontend shows a message (e.g. "Insufficient loyalty points").

  Caching: When Redis is configured, the aggregated feed and per-source data
  (YouTube, Reddit, Hacker News, News) are cached for 30 minutes. Repeated
  requests with the same query parameters return cached data until the TTL
  expires.


================================================================================
15. PULSEBOT
================================================================================

PulseBot is an AI companion that works with the user's linked Telegram
account and (optionally) Gmail for email tasks and scheduled emails.

  Linking Telegram: The user requests a link code (or similar). The backend
  generates a short-lived code (e.g. 10 minutes) and instructions: the user
  must open Telegram, find the Pluto PulseBot, and send the code to the bot.
  Once the bot confirms, the user's Pluto account is linked to their Telegram
  identity. The page shows whether the user is "Linked" or "Not linked." If not
  linked, the user must complete the link flow before using summary, ask, or
  stats. For the bot to receive messages, the backend must register a webhook
  with Telegram (admin/deployment concern; the user does not configure this).

  Summary: The user clicks "Generate summary" (or similar). The backend
  collects recent messages from the user's linked Telegram groups (e.g. last
  12 hours), sends them to an AI, and returns a short summary. Cost: loyalty
  points (e.g. 10 pts). Insufficient balance shows an error. The summary
  text is displayed.

  Ask (Q&A): The user types a question and submits. The backend uses the same
  recent Telegram context and AI to answer in the context of those chats. Cost:
  loyalty points (e.g. 10 pts per ask). The answer is displayed.

  Stats: The user requests "Group activity" or "Stats." The backend returns
  non-AI stats (e.g. list of groups, message counts, active users in a
  period). Cost: loyalty points (e.g. 2 pts).

  Gmail & email tasks: After connecting Gmail (OAuth) on the PulseBot page,
  the user can sync the inbox, see AI-generated "email tasks" (e.g. replies
  needed), open a task to view the email and get an AI-suggested reply (costs
  loyalty), and send the reply. The list-tasks result is cached by user and
  email IDs (e.g. 1 hour TTL) so repeated views do not trigger extra AI calls.

  Scheduled emails: The user composes an email (to, subject, body), picks a
  date/time, and submits. The backend stores it; a cron job (e.g. every
  minute) sends scheduled emails when the time is due. The user can list
  pending and recently sent items (sent items are only shown for 24 hours),
  and edit or delete pending ones.

  Caching (Ask): When Redis is configured, the answer for a given user and
  question (combined with current chat context) is cached for 2 minutes. If
  the user retries the same question within that window, the cached answer
  is returned and no loyalty points are deducted.


================================================================================
16. WALLET (BUY LOYALTY)
================================================================================

The user can purchase loyalty points via a mock wallet flow.

  The user clicks "Buy loyalty" (or similar). A modal or page opens. The user
  may connect a wallet (e.g. via RainbowKit/WalletConnect) if not already
  connected. The user selects an amount of loyalty points to buy (or a preset,
  e.g. min 10, max 10,000, default 100). The UI may show an equivalent "mock"
  crypto amount. The user confirms. The backend creates a "pending" order; the
  frontend may simulate a transaction (e.g. mock transaction hash). The user
  then "confirms" the order (e.g. "Confirm" button); the backend credits the
  loyalty points and updates the order status. The modal closes and the
  profile balance updates. No real payment is processed; this is for
  demonstration only.


================================================================================
17. DAILY REWARDS
================================================================================

The user can claim a daily reward once per 24 hours.

  Eligibility: Cooldown of 24 hours between claims. Streak: day 1 to day 7.
  Each day has a fixed reward (e.g. day 1 = 10 pts, day 2 = 20, …, day 7 = 70).
  Exact values are configured in the backend.

  Claim: The user clicks "Claim daily" (or similar). The backend checks the
  last claim time; if 24 hours have passed, it awards the points for the
  current streak day, increments the streak (capped at 7), and updates the
  "last claim" time. If not yet 24 hours, the backend returns "cannot claim"
  and the frontend shows the next claim time (e.g. "Next claim in 12h").

  Streak reset: If the user misses a full 24-hour window (per
  implementation), the streak may reset to 1. The user sees the current streak
  and next reward on the profile.


================================================================================
18. PRIVACY, TERMS, AND FEEDBACK
================================================================================

  Privacy Policy (/privacy): Static page describing what information is
  collected (e.g. email, username, profile, usage), how it is used (operate
  Pluto, auth, support, analytics), data retention and security, user rights
  (access, correct, delete, withdraw consent), cookies, and how policy
  changes are communicated. Last-updated date is shown. The user can return to
  home.

  Terms of Service (/terms): Static page with acceptance of terms, description
  of service, eligibility and account responsibility, loyalty points and
  conduct (no abuse, no cash value unless stated), intellectual property,
  disclaimer of warranties, limitation of liability, governing law, and
  contact. Last-updated date is shown. The user can return to home.

  Feedback (landing page): In the "Feedback" section near the bottom of the
  landing page, the user can submit a message (required) and optionally name
  and email. On submit, data is sent to the backend and stored in the
  database. A success message is shown; the user can send another. No login
  is required.


================================================================================
19. RESPONSIVE & MOBILE UI
================================================================================

  Navbar & mobile menu
    On small screens the main nav links (Campquest, Agora, ChainLens,
    Trendcraft, PulseBot) are hidden. A hamburger button opens a full-width
    overlay menu with those links and Log out. The notifications bell and
    profile avatar remain in the header. Safe-area insets and touch-friendly
    targets (e.g. min 44px) are used for notched devices and tap accuracy.

  Agora on mobile
    On viewports below the "lg" breakpoint, the Agora sidebar is hidden. A
    fixed bottom navigation bar appears with Feed, Alerts, Messages, Tips,
    Create Cast, and Profile so users can navigate Agora on mobile without
    the sidebar. The main content area is full-width and scrollable.

  Notifications panel
    The notification dropdown (navbar bell) is responsive: on mobile it uses
    a smaller max width (e.g. 260px) and max height (50vh) so it stays within
    the viewport and does not overflow; text wraps to avoid horizontal
    overflow.

  Landing & Docs
    Landing feature cards grow with content so "Try Agora", "Try Campquest",
    etc. are always visible; CTA links are styled as tappable buttons. The
    Docs page uses overflow-x-hidden; on mobile a dropdown replaces the
    sidebar for section navigation. Main page wrappers use overflow-x-hidden
    to avoid horizontal scroll on small screens.


================================================================================
20. USER FLOWS
================================================================================

20.1 New user: Sign up and first actions

  1. User opens Pluto (landing).
  2. User clicks "Sign up" or "Get started" and goes to the signup page.
  3. User enters email, password, and optionally a referral code; submits.
     Account is created; if the referral code is valid, the referrer receives
     points.
  4. User is logged in (or redirected to login). User logs in with email and
     password.
  5. User lands on home or profile. Sees loyalty balance (e.g. 0 or starter
     bonus if any).
  6. User goes to Profile and claims the daily reward (e.g. 10 pts for day 1).
     Balance updates.
  7. User browses Campaigns, opens one, and verifies a quest (e.g. submits
     tweet URL). Receives the quest completion reward (e.g. 25 pts). Balance
     increases.
  8. Optionally, the user goes to Trendcraft or PulseBot and uses a feature
     (costs points). Balance decreases.

20.2 Creator: Create campaign and add quests

  1. User logs in and goes to the campaigns list.
  2. User clicks "Create campaign." In the modal, enters name, description,
     optional expiry (days); submits. Loyalty points (e.g. 100) are deducted;
     campaign is created; user is redirected to the campaign detail page.
  3. On the campaign detail page, user clicks "Add quest." In the modal,
     enters title, description, type (e.g. "Follow"), required link/handle;
     submits. Loyalty points (e.g. 50) are deducted; quest appears in the list.
  4. User repeats "Add quest" for more quests (each costs loyalty). User sets
     campaign status to "Active" so others can participate.
  5. Other users can now join the campaign and verify quests to earn points.

20.3 Participant: Complete a quest

  1. User logs in and goes to the campaigns list; opens an active campaign.
  2. User reads a quest (e.g. "Follow @PlutoApp on X"). User performs the
     action outside Pluto (e.g. follows on X).
  3. User clicks "Verify" on that quest. A modal or form may ask for proof
     (e.g. tweet URL). User enters it and submits.
  4. Backend validates (e.g. checks tweet or mock). If valid, user receives
     the configured points (e.g. 25) and the quest shows "Verified." If
     invalid, an error is shown; the user can fix and try again if allowed.

20.4 Agora: Post, like, tip

  1. User logs in and goes to Agora.
  2. User writes a post (text, within limit) and submits. Post appears in the
     feed and on the user's profile.
  3. Another user sees the post and clicks "Like." Like count increments.
  4. Another user clicks "Tip," enters amount (e.g. 50 pts), and confirms.
     Tipper's balance decreases by 50; author's balance increases by 50. The
     tip is recorded.

20.5 Feedback submission (no login)

  1. User is on the landing page (may be a guest).
  2. User scrolls to "Send feedback."
  3. User types a message and optionally name and email; clicks "Send feedback."
  4. Backend stores the feedback in the database and returns success. User
     sees "Thank you for your feedback" and can send another.

================================================================================
22. TECHNICAL OVERVIEW
================================================================================

22.1 Frontend

  Pluto's web application is built with React and TypeScript. The build tool
  is Vite. Styling uses Tailwind CSS. Routing is handled by React Router.
  Authentication is session-based: the frontend stores a token and sends it with
  protected API requests. Google sign-in uses a redirect flow to a callback URL.
  Wallet connection (for the mock loyalty purchase) uses RainbowKit/WalletConnect.

22.2 Backend

  The backend is a Node.js application using Express and TypeScript. Data is
  stored in MongoDB (Mongoose). Authentication uses JWT; Google sign-in is
  validated with the Google identity token. All API routes are under the /api
  prefix. Protected routes require a valid token in the Authorization header.
  Some routes support optional auth (e.g. public feed); others require an admin
  role (e.g. moderation).

  Rate limiting: All /api requests are subject to a general rate limit (e.g.
  200 requests per 15 minutes per IP). Auth routes (register, login, Google
  login) have a stricter limit (e.g. 10 requests per 15 minutes per IP) to
  reduce brute-force and credential-stuffing risk. When exceeded, the API
  returns 429 Too Many Requests with a JSON message.

  Caching: When REDIS_URL is set, the backend uses Redis for response
  caching. ChainLens results are cached by wallet address and chain (TTL 1
  hour). Trendcraft feed and source endpoints (YouTube, Reddit, Hacker News,
  News) are cached by query parameters (TTL 30 minutes). PulseBot "Ask"
  responses are cached by user and a hash of question plus chat context (TTL
  2 minutes). If REDIS_URL is not set, caching is skipped and all requests
  hit the external APIs or AI as before.

22.3 Main API areas

  Auth: registration, login, Google login, get/update current user.
  Daily claim: status, claim.
  Campaigns: create, list, get, update, delete; add quest.
  Quests: list, get, update, delete, verify.
  Wallet: mock buy loyalty, confirm order.
  Landing (public): leaderboard (top users by points), platform stats,
  submit feedback.
  Agora: posts, feed, likes, replies, tips, follow, bookmarks, DMs,
  notifications, reports, admin hide.
  ChainLens: wallet insights (external provider).
  Trendcraft: feed, YouTube/Reddit/Hacker News/News, generate content,
  content suggestions.
  PulseBot: link code, current user link status, summary, ask, stats,
  webhook (Telegram).
  Email integration: Gmail OAuth, sync, tasks (cached by user + email IDs),
  digest, scheduled emails (CRUD, cron sends at scheduled time; sent items
  shown for 24h), suggest-reply, send-reply.

22.4 Data

  User accounts, campaigns, quests, quest completions, loyalty transactions,
  feedback submissions, and Agora data (posts, likes, replies, tips, follows,
  bookmarks, conversations, messages, notifications, reports) are stored in
  the database. PulseBot link state and related data are stored as required
  by the backend. Daily claim records support streak and cooldown logic.

22.5 Rate limiting and caching (summary)

  Rate limiting
    General API: limit per IP per 15-minute window (e.g. 200 requests).
    Auth (register, login, Google): stricter limit per IP (e.g. 10 per 15
    minutes). Response: 429 with JSON message when limit exceeded.

  Caching (optional Redis)
    Requires REDIS_URL in backend environment. When configured:
    ChainLens: key = wallet address + chain; TTL 1 hour. Cache hit returns
    stored insight without deducting loyalty points.
    Trendcraft: feed and per-source responses (YouTube, Reddit, Hacker News,
    News) cached by query parameters; TTL 30 minutes.
    PulseBot Ask: key = user ID + hash(question + chat context); TTL 2
    minutes. Cache hit returns stored answer without deducting loyalty points.
